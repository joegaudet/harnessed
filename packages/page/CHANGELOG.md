# @harnessed-ts/page

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- d00bf4e: API mocking, the same under every runner. The new `@harnessed-ts/mock` holds one handler model and each driver registers the transport that intercepts requests under its runner: `page.route` under Playwright, request interception under Puppeteer, a request hook under TestCafe, one catch-all `cy.intercept` under Cypress, an agent injected by a WebDriver BiDi preload script under WebdriverIO, and `fetch`, XHR and `WebSocket` patched in the page (through `@mswjs/interceptors`, an optional peer) under Testing Library, Ember, Vitest browser mode and Storybook. Every driver has a `/mock` entry: `import { mock, json } from '@harnessed-ts/playwright/mock'`.

  `mock(env, { scope, state, onUnhandled, openapi })` returns the mock for that env's network. Handlers come three ways — the fluent `api.get('/api/users/:id').once().delay(200).reply(…)`, MSW-shaped tables (`http.get`, `graphql.query`), and API harness classes (`@Api`, `@Get`, `@Post`…) overridable per route — and the newest matching handler answers. Builders cover JSON, text, HTML, XML, bytes, files, forms, server-sent events, NDJSON, chunked streams, every common status, RFC 9457 problem details, JSON:API and GraphQL results, network errors, aborts and hangs; `defineFactory` builds deterministic test data. A request in scope that nothing answers fails the test, naming it. Requests are logged with parsed bodies, `waitFor` waits for one, and `toHaveBeenRequested`, `toHaveBeenRequestedTimes` and `toHaveBeenRequestedWith` join every driver's matchers (`requested`/`requestedWith` for Chai, `assert.requests(route)` for QUnit). Mocks can be validated against an OpenAPI document, a GraphQL schema (`@harnessed-ts/mock/graphql`) or a Standard Schema, typed from openapi-typescript output with `typedApi`, replayed from a HAR (recorded under Playwright and Puppeteer), and built from existing MSW handlers. `api.ws()` mocks WebSockets everywhere but TestCafe; streams are delivered in pieces under the in-page runners and WebdriverIO, and whole elsewhere. `resetMocks()` ends every mock after a test; `@harnessed-ts/mock/vitest`, Ember's `setupMocks(hooks)`, Playwright's `withMocks(test)`, Cypress's support import and Storybook's preview do it for you.

  `@harnessed-ts/core` adds `registerBeforeNavigate`, and `PageHarness.goto()` awaits it: a mock is intercepting before the page loads. A page may declare the mocks it always needs with `get mocks()`. Storybook stories declare theirs in `parameters.harnessed.mocks` (with `harnessed()` from `@harnessed-ts/storybook/mock`), Gherkin worlds expose `mocks`, and the conformance catalog gains a data view (in React and its Glimmer port) and `mockSpecs`, run by every runner.

  `createApiStubs` in `@harnessed-ts/playwright` is now built on `mock()` and deprecated; it is removed in the next minor. `@harnessed-ts/eslint-plugin` adds `no-raw-intercept` and `await-mock-install`, and `@harnessed-ts/claude` documents mocking for each detected runner, with an API harness template.

### Minor Changes

- 9666a3d: `PageHarness.urlFor(params)` returns the URL `goto()` would navigate to — params substituted at every occurrence and URL-encoded — without navigating, and under any driver. A runner that queues its own navigation (Cypress's `cy.visit`) needs the URL without the `goto()`. Covered by two new conformance specs: `urlFor` under a driver that cannot navigate, and `goto` landing on exactly the URL `urlFor` reports.
- 1823546: `isVisible()`, `waitFor('visible')` and `waitFor('hidden')` on a target matching
  several nodes now reject with the shared strict-mode violation, at once, under
  every driver. The dom, Ember, Vitest browser mode and Cypress drivers answered
  `false` from `isVisible()`, waited out the timeout in `waitFor('visible')`, and —
  worse — resolved `waitFor('hidden')` at once, passing a wait for three rendered
  nodes to disappear; Playwright's waits raised its own wording instead of the
  shared one. An `nth()`
  past the last match answers `false` from `isVisible()` and counts as hidden, as it
  does under Playwright — Puppeteer and TestCafe used to reject it as an index out
  of range.

  Core exports `StrictModeViolation`, the class `strictViolation()` now returns, so a
  driver can tell ambiguity apart from absence. It is the class a caller catches
  under every driver: core also exports `reviveStrictViolation()`, which the
  Puppeteer, WebdriverIO and TestCafe drivers apply to what the page throws, so
  a violation raised in the page arrives as core's class, worded exactly as an
  in-process driver words it. `instanceof StrictModeViolation` checks a brand
  rather than the prototype, so it holds across two copies of core in one page —
  Cypress bundles the support file and each spec separately.

  `WaitState` now documents the rule it is held to: a state joins only when every
  driver honours it with the same meaning, so a runner's own states — Playwright's
  `attached` and `detached` — stay out of the shared interface.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- b2d1130: Harnesses can reach into iframes. `frame(selector)` marks an `<iframe>` in a
  scope chain, and everything scoped under it resolves inside the frame's
  document:

  - `@ChildHarness(Cls, { frame: testId('…') })` and `childHarness(Cls, { frame })`
    nest an unchanged harness inside a frame — the harness written for an embedded
    app drives it from the page that embeds it.
  - `@Harness({ host: frame(testId('…')) })` makes the iframe itself the host:
    `self` is the element, fields are inside its document.
  - Inside a frame, `{ global: true }` searches the frame's document, so a framed
    harness still finds its own portals.
  - A page nested in a frame refuses `goto()` and its other URL members, which
    would otherwise act on the page around it.

  Playwright enters cross-origin frames via `Locator.contentFrame()`, so
  `@harnessed-ts/playwright` (and the conformance suite) now need
  `@playwright/test` ≥ 1.43. The dom driver enters same-origin frames and refuses
  a cross-origin or non-iframe target with an error naming it. Conformance adds
  guarantee 10.

- 66deb00: Page objects. `PageHarness` (new package `@harnessed-ts/page`) replaces
  `RouteHarness`: a page is a screen composed of component harnesses and other
  pages, that constructs under every driver, knows when it has arrived
  (`expectReady()` / `isReady()`), optionally owns a URL (`path` + `goto()`), and
  hands back the page an action leads to (`transitionTo()`).

  - `@harnessed-ts/route` is now a deprecated shim re-exporting `PageHarness` as
    `RouteHarness`. It is removed in the next minor. Two source-level changes
    reach existing routes through it: `path` is no longer abstract, so under
    `noImplicitOverride` a `get path()` needs the `override` modifier; and
    `goto()` now wraps a failed `waitForReady()` as `<Page> did not become ready.`
    with the original error as `cause`.
  - `@ChildHarness` and `childHarness()` accept any harness, so pages nest pages.
  - Matchers accept any harness with a host, pages included.
  - **Breaking config rename:** `layout.screens` → `layout.pages`,
    `layout.screenHarnesses` → `layout.pageHarnesses`, `testIdPattern.screen` →
    `testIdPattern.page` (default `page-<kebab>`). An old `harnessed.config.ts`
    is a compile error until updated. The `@harnessed-ts/claude` CLI flags rename
    likewise (`--pages`, `--page-harnesses`, `--page-testid`).
  - New `strict`-only rule `no-component-harness-in-test`: tests enter through a
    page. Runtime-agnostic via `testFiles` globs; a file that renders the component
    itself is exempt.
  - `require-wait-for-ready` now checks `PageHarness` (and the deprecated
    `RouteHarness`).
  - Conformance: `routeSpecs` became `pageSpecs` (every driver) and `urlSpecs`
    (navigating drivers).

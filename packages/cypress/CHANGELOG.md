### Minor Changes

- 9666a3d: A new Cypress driver for e2e and component tests: `cy.harness(Cls, async h => …)` runs a harness inside one command against the application under test, `cy.visitPage(Page, params)` visits a page's `urlFor()` and waits for it to be ready, and `goto()` works inside the bridge in e2e tests. Interactions use user-event by default, or trusted Chrome DevTools Protocol input with `realEvents: true` on Chromium.
- 1823546: `isVisible()`, `waitFor('visible')` and `waitFor('hidden')` on a target matching
  several nodes now reject with the shared strict-mode violation, at once, under
  every driver. The dom, Ember, Vitest browser mode and Cypress drivers answered
  `false` from `isVisible()`, waited out the timeout in `waitFor('visible')`, and —
  worse — resolved `waitFor('hidden')` at once, passing a wait for three rendered
  nodes to disappear; Playwright's waits raised its own wording instead of the
  shared one. An `nth()`
  past the last match answers `false` from `isVisible()` and counts as hidden, as it
  does under Playwright — Puppeteer and TestCafe used to reject it as an index out
  of range.

  Core exports `StrictModeViolation`, the class `strictViolation()` now returns, so a
  driver can tell ambiguity apart from absence. It is the class a caller catches
  under every driver: core also exports `reviveStrictViolation()`, which the
  Puppeteer, WebdriverIO and TestCafe drivers apply to what the page throws, so
  a violation raised in the page arrives as core's class, worded exactly as an
  in-process driver words it. `instanceof StrictModeViolation` checks a brand
  rather than the prototype, so it holds across two copies of core in one page —
  Cypress bundles the support file and each spec separately.

  `WaitState` now documents the rule it is held to: a state joins only when every
  driver honours it with the same meaning, so a runner's own states — Playwright's
  `attached` and `detached` — stay out of the shared interface.
